## Vision

An **agentic, multi-layer, GenAI-powered backbone** to make AI systems **explainable**, **accountable**, and **human-centered**.
The project envisions an adaptable and trustworthy AI ecosystem that integrates explainability, fairness, autonomy, and robustness at every stage of AI development.

---

## Objectives

- **Build an adaptable, explainable AI-agentic platform**
  Develop interoperable modules that connect explainability, accountability, and fairness.

- **Define and assess AI trustworthiness**
  Establish measurable criteria and indicators for evaluating the reliability and ethical alignment of AI systems.

- **Advance explainable multimodal foundation models**
  Drive research in interpretable vision–language–reasoning systems.

- **Demonstrate real-world impact through pilot use cases**
  Validate the framework across sectors including healthcare, employment, and education.
