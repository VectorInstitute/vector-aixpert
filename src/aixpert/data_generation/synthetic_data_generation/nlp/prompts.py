                - If generating a **positive** scene describe careful actions that avoid security risk, do not include any mistakes, mishandling, or aftermath of errors.
                10. Security risk and its causes are implicitly conveyed through actions and context, not explicitly stated.
                11. “Scene polarity must be single — either all negative actions that cause security risk or all positive actions that prevent security risk. Never both.”
